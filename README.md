## Running your own API

### Pre-requisites

First, you need to install a SpeedTracker dashboard by following steps 1 to 3 from [the SpeedTracker documentation page](https://speedtracker.org/docs).
For configuration, follow the [*Configuration*](https://speedtracker.org/docs#configuration) and [*Configuration > Profiles*](https://speedtracker.org/docs#profiles) sections.

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), `npm` and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository in the location you want to run your API instance

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:speedtracker/speedtracker-api.git
  cd speedtracker-api
  ```

1. Run `npm install`

1. Create a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) in your GitHub account  under *Settings* > *Personal access tokens*
  - Be sure to check the option `public_repo`, since this is needed for the API to update and commit new performance data to your public GitHub version.

1. Create a file called `config.{ENVIRONMENT}.json` (e.g. `config.development.json`) with the following structure:

  ```js
  {
    // The port to run the API on (e.g. 8080)
    "port": 1234, 
    
    // Your WebPageTest API key
    "wpt": {
      "key": "abcdefg"
    },
    
    // Your GitHub personal access token
    "githubToken": "abcdefg",
    
    // MongoDB database connection URI
    "database": {
      "uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017/speedtracker"
    }
  }
  ```


### Run

The API instance is ready to run. Run `npm start` and, assuming you've followed the steps above on your local machine, you can access your API on `http://localhost:8080` (or whatever port you chose).

If you see the `{"success":false,"error":"INVALID_URL_OR_METHOD"}` in your browser, the API is ready to be used. You'll see this message since we didn't supply the full URL the API needs to run a test. To do that, go to:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/test/{USERNAME}/{REPOSITORY}/{BRANCH}/{PROFILE}?key={KEY}
```

And check [the documentation page](https://speedtracker.org/docs#run) for more information.
